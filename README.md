# Store Management System

## Overview

The Store Management System is a desktop application built using Python's `tkinter` library for the GUI and MySQL for the database. It is designed to help manage various aspects of a store, including customer information, product inventory, sales, and billing. The application supports role-based access control, where users can log in as either an "Admin" or "Employee," each with different levels of access and functionality.

## Features

### 1. **Role-Based Login**
   - **Admin**: Full access to all features, including adding, editing, and viewing customers, products, and bills.
   - **Employee**: Limited access, primarily for viewing customers and adding products to the cart.

### 2. **Tabbed Interface**
   - **Customers**: View, add, and manage customer details. Admins can see additional mobile number fields, while employees can only see customer names.
   - **Products**: View product inventory, including name, number, type, and amount. Admins can edit product details.
   - **Cart**: Add products to the cart and calculate the total amount for a purchase. Users can also generate bills.
   - **Bills** (Admin only): View and manage bills generated by the system.

### 3. **Database Interaction**
   - The application connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve data for customers, products, and bills.
   - SQL queries are used for operations such as inserting, updating, and fetching data.

### 4. **Error Handling and User Feedback**
   - Provides error messages for invalid login attempts.
   - Alerts users when required fields are missing or when operations are successful.

### 5. **Security Features**
   - Limits functionality based on the user's role.
   - Restricts access to certain tabs after three failed login attempts.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
- **MySQL**: A MySQL server must be running, and you should have access to create a database.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `tkinter`: Included with most Python installations.
  - `mysql-connector-python`: Install using pip if not already available.
    ```bash
    pip install mysql-connector-python
    ```

### Database Setup
1. **Create the Database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE dbms_project;
   ```

2. **Create Tables**:
   ```sql
   USE dbms_project;

   CREATE TABLE roles (
       role_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       role_name VARCHAR(50)
   );

   CREATE TABLE login (
       user_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       username VARCHAR(50),
       login_password VARCHAR(50)
   );

   CREATE TABLE customer (
       cus_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       cus_name VARCHAR(100),
       mobile VARCHAR(15)
   );

   CREATE TABLE product (
       prod_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       product_name VARCHAR(100),
       product_number INT,
       product_type VARCHAR(50),
       product_price DECIMAL(10, 2)
   );

   CREATE TABLE bill (
       bill_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       user_id INT,
       cus_id INT,
       bill_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
       bill_date DATE
   );

   CREATE TABLE bill_details (
       bill_id INT,
       prod_id INT,
       quantity INT,
       price DECIMAL(10, 2),
       PRIMARY KEY (bill_id, prod_id)
   );

   -- Insert default roles
   INSERT INTO roles (role_name) VALUES ('Admin'), ('Employee');
   ```

3. **Insert Admin and Employee Users**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO login (username, login_password) VALUES ('admin', 'admin123'), ('employee', 'employee123');
   ```

### Running the Application
1. Ensure the MySQL server is running.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python store_management_app.py
   ```
3. Use the Admin credentials (`admin/admin123`) or Employee credentials (`employee/employee123`) to log in and explore the application.

## Important Notes
- **MySQL Connection**: Ensure the MySQL connection parameters in the script (`host`, `user`, `passwd`, `database`) are correct.
- **Database Structure**: The database schema should match the queries in the application.
- **Security**: The application currently stores passwords in plaintext for simplicity. In a production environment, consider hashing passwords and using a more secure method for storing and verifying credentials.

## Future Improvements
- **Encryption**: Encrypt passwords in the database.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for database operations.
- **User Interface**: Enhance the UI for better user experience.
- **Reporting**: Add features for generating reports based on sales data.
